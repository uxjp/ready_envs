# Ubuntu GitHub SSH
Creates an image to be able to edit files with nvim and make contributions to your GitHub.  

![dev.sh exec output](images/dev-sh.png)

Works plug and play with Ubuntu and MacOS.
This image just gets me a read to go enviroment with the minimum resorces I need to start coding within a Ubuntu container using an bash interactive section.  
To profit from this repo you should be apt to develop directly from the cli.  
It uses a doppler.com to store sensitive data necessary to access GitHub, removing the use of .env files to store environment variables.

## Run
```bash
./dev.sh
```
And feed your Doppler.com Access token. If your credentials and doppler secrets are configured as explained below your container will be read to pull and push from your github.

## Dependencies
- Doppler.com account
- Github SSH Key

## Credentials
I'm assuming you already have generated your SSH Keys, and that your Public Key is registered on your GitHub Account.

### GitHub SSH conection
- Create(if don't already have) a ssh key locally.
- Get hold of the values of the public and private keys(they probably be at ~/.ssh)
- Configure the key to be used as a new SSH Key in your GitHub account.
The connection will be automatically setup at container runtime using the `run.sh` script.

### Doppler.com
- Create a Doppler.com account (its free for the use case of this repo).
- Create a project.
- Set 4 Secrets for a `branch` like `dev`: ID_RSA_PUB_GITHUB, ID_RSA_GITHUB, GITHUB_EMAIL, GITHUB_NAME.

### Set up doppler in the Host Machine
Host machine relative to the docker container.
- Get a Doppler Service Token and Copy it
```
doppler.com login > project > [your project] > [branch] > access tab > generate new service token
```
- execute `auth-doppler.sh` and feed it your Doppler.com Service Token. Or just execute the `run.sh`

### Testing that Doppler is set up
```bash
doppler run -- bash -c 'echo "GITHUB_NAME: $GITHUB_NAME" && echo "GITHUB_EMAIL: $GITHUB_EMAIL"'
```

### Run your Dev Container
execute:  
```
dev.sh
```

## If the Container Stops
Most likely you accidentally stops the contianer just, start it and run a new intercative section with `exec`:  
```bash
docker start <container-id>
docker exec -it <container-id> bash
```

## Ubuntu container with Neovim
This repo is a improvemnet of the use case bellow. Run a Ubuntu container with Neovim properly installed:  
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash -c "apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y neovim && bash"
```
